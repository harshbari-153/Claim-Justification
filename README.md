# Claim-Justification
This project focuses on claim-justification matching using NLP, introducing an efficient word embedding method that processes only subject and predicate of claims and justifications, achieving accuracy similar to sentence-BERT with 33% faster training and 50% less computational load, applicable in real-world scenarios like fake claims detection.
